Feel the roar with this chart, and I'm not lion!

Thank you to Taronuke for fixing my actorproxy issues + thank you to R.O.B., oatmealine and Puuro for helping with troubleshooting.

This is my third file, and I'm happy to say it's my best one yet. All of it is eases this time! Some transitions are still a little janky, and I would have loved to have a sprite in there, but I don't know how to draw :peeeshmeme2:. Overall, I'm happy with this file, and I hope you enjoy it too!
